### Meta-Notes
These documents are intended as a supplement to an introductory talk on Information Security for (non-IT) professionals, such as journalists, doctors, lawyers, counselors, political activists, etc.

Thus: 

- They're not necessarily elaborate enough to be fully self-contained.
- They're not meant to elucidate every aspect comprehensively and objectively, but to give some opionated advice on "the best" tool to use for users with
    - average (or maybe slightly lower) technical IT background, and
    - average (or somewhat higher) need for privacy and security of information.
