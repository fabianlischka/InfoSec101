### Meta-Notes
These documents are intended as a supplement to an introductory talk on Information Security for (non-IT) professionals.

Thus: 

- They're not necessarily elaborate enough to be fully self-contained.
- They're not meant to elucidate every aspect comprehensively and objectively, but to give some opionated advice on "the best" tool to use for users with
    - average technical IT background, and
    - somewhat above average need for privacy and security of information.
