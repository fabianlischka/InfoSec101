# Information Security for (Non-IT) Professionals

## What are the issues?

### What are the issues: Types of Security

- **Privacy**
  - **Confidentiality:** Nobody can read the message, except recipient. (*Encryption, Secure Channel*)
  - **Anonymity:** Nobody can figure out your name or location
- **Security**
  - **Integrity:** Nobody has messed with your message. (*Signature*)
  - **Authentication:** The recipient is who you think they are. (*No MitM attack*)

### What are the issues: Some Problems

- Your IP can identify you
- Email is (essentially) like a postcard, not like a letter: Everyone can read your email

### What are the issues: Concrete Examples

### What are the issues: Some Background Knowledge



## Why should you care?

### Why should you care: Examples

## What to do?

### What to do: Simple steps

#### Simple steps: Passwords
security questions - give bogus answers like `"T$adf^VFBG(*&O(NUIUgfsohmpRV%$CEV%R^BHN*UOI))"`
multi-factor authentication

2-Factor authentication
Advantages, Disadvantages
(SMS, travel, lose phone)

#### Simple steps: Disk Encryption

#### Simple steps: VPNs

#### Simple steps: Browser Extensions

### What to do: Suggested Tools

#### Suggested Tools: Password Managers

- Password Managers allow you to use different (secure) passwords for different sites
- Password Managers store these passwords securely
  - Storage locally (better security, less convenience)
  - Storage in the Cloud (easier sync, automatic backup, less secure)
- Password Managers require one Master Password (better be good!)
- Available on desktop and smart phones
 
#### Suggested Tools: Secure Email

#### Suggested Tools: Secure Chat

#### Suggested Tools: Secure Browsing
security certificates


### What to do: Today!

## Further Resources


- tracking: cookies and other tools track you across browser sessions (profile building)
- tracking: evil google
- censorship: the Great Firewall of China




Difference: anonymous, private


Basic protection
(password manager, disk encryption, VPN, Tor)
- problems: 
- solutions: good unique passwords -> password manager



password managers

- Keypass X (OS X, Windows, Linux)
- LastPass (OS X, Windows, iOS, Android)
- Keychain (OS X, iOS)


Basic protection

- problem: email = postcard
- solutions:



WiFi
Problems:
Solutions: VPN

Communicate among each other securely
Be reached a) securely, b) anonymously
Solution: PGP, keybase

- There do not appear to be any legal restrictions on what the NSA can do with the communications of non-U.S. persons. Since a substantial fraction of the world’s Internet data passes through the United States, or its allies, the U.S. has the ability to observe and record the communications of much of the world’s population.

- Some senior executives have been duped into clicking on links sent from the accounts of longtime clients, in which the supposed client reveals that they found an employee’s negative comments about the executive in an investment forum. [...] the links or attachments redirect their victim to a fake email login page, designed to steal the victim’s credentials, so that the attacker can log into and read the contents of their emails.

Syrian sources may be tempted to engage in insufficient security practices if they do not fully understand the regime's surveillance capabilities. It's incumbent on journalists to insist on secure communications when dealing with this exceptionally high-risk population
