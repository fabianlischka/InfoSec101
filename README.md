InfoSec101
==========

An introduction to Information Security for (non-IT) professionals, e.g. Journalists, Doctors, Lawyers, etc.

Notes:
* This is intended as a supplement to a talk about Information Security, as a resource with 
  * things to do
  * links to tools and apps to install, and
  * links to further background and resources if desired.
* Given that it is intended as a supplement to a live talk, it need not be fully self-contained.
* Goals:
  * cover the basics to 
    * protect (non-IT) professionals (ie smart people, but not computer/IT/crypto experts)
    * from opportunistic and primitive targeted attacks 
      (ie against random hackers and criminals, government mass surveillance, etc.)
  * not to overwhelm busy professionals with too much irrelevant details
  * editorialise heavily, in the sense of recommending one or two "best" apps in a category, instead of 
    providing an endless list.
    (Yes, there is not one best app, and many shades of gray and subtleties - but if we can't make up our
    mind after thinking and reading about these things for a long time, we can't expect non-experts to sit
    down and research it and make a better decision by themselves. Always keep this typical response of a 
    busy user in mind: "I don't care about all the details -- JUST TELL ME which app to use."
    We should not grumble at this response, but oblige and make a sensible default
    choice, or at least outline in non-technical terms under which circumstances a solution might be 
    preferable to another.)
