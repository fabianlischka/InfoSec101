### Snowden on Governments and Information Security 2014

> Each time you pick up the phone, dial a number, write an email, make a purchase, travel on the bus carrying a cellphone, swipe a card somewhere, you leave a trace – and the government has decided that it’s a good idea to collect it all, everything. Even if you’ve never been suspected of any crime.

### What are the issues: Some Problems

- Your IP ("Internet Protocol" address, such as 62.138.116.3) can identify you
- Email is (essentially) like a postcard, not like a letter: Everyone can read your email
- By default, most internet traffic is unencrypted, and can be read by your ISP, the guys in the Cafe next to you, and your favorite governments
- Weak or shared passwords can be compromised
- Phishing attacks induce you to reveal your password to fraudulent sites
- MITM attacks (internet cafe)

### Why should you care?

1. Protect yourself, your information, your sources
    - Your account could be hacked, and all your information deleted
    - Your communication with sources could be monitored
2. Learn about it, in case you really need it
    - When Greenwald was first contacted by Snowden, there was some delay because Greenwald did not have the required software and expertise
3. Network effect: The more people use it, the more useful
    - For example, the "Signal" app allows you to make free, encrypted calls -- but only to other people that have it installed!
4. Make it normal, rather than a "red flag"
    - The rumor is that the NSA records ALL encrypted communication it encounters


### What are the issues: Some Examples

> GCHQ captured emails of journalists from top international media. Snowden files reveal emails of BBC, NY Times and more. Agency includes investigative journalists on ‘threat’ list.

> There do not appear to be any legal restrictions on what the NSA can do with the communications of non-U.S. persons. Since a substantial fraction of the world’s Internet data passes through the United States, or its allies, **the U.S. has the ability to observe and record the communications of much of the world’s population**.

> Snowden only wanted to communicate securely using PGP encryption, for which Greenwald didn’t have the proper software installed [...] Greenwald didn't know what his would-be source had (or didn't have) and continued to prioritize other stories instead.

> Some senior executives have been duped into clicking on links sent from the accounts of longtime clients, in which the supposed client reveals that they found an employee’s negative comments about the executive in an investment forum. [...] the links or attachments redirect their victim to a fake email login page, designed to steal the victim’s credentials, so that the attacker can log into and read the contents of their emails.

> [T]he NSA can eavesdrop on most of the world's cell phone networks, and [...] it tracks location data. [...] [A company] sells a system that can "locate and track any phone number in the world...undetected and unknown by the network, carrier, or the target."
